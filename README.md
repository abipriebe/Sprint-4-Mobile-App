# Overview

I created an Android App that generates random addition problems, gives four answer choices, awards the user points for every correct answer, and revokes points for incorrect answers. The user is given 30 seconds to solve as many equations as possible. 

This is the first app I have created and it was incredibly helpful in helping me to get comfortable working in android studio, which I have never done before this project, and with Javascript, which I have very little experience with.
